## Tip 1:
In fact, [] and () are valid HTML chars in attributes. If you generate HTML code on the server-side or use any other pre-processor that can't handle those characters, you can always use the equivalent canonical syntax.

[] is a shorthand for bind-*, hence [propertyName] == bind-property-name
() is a shorthand for on-*, hence (eventName) == on-event-name
